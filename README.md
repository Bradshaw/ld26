Gaeel is doing Ludum Dare #26
=============================


Walk into the club I'm like, what up I got a big cock

Theme is "minimalism"

Step one: looking for inspiration
=================================

+ Listening to Burial


Step two: It's going to be a SAD game
=====================================

+ Maybe listening to Burial was a bit overkill
+ A girl, the last person
+ She is going to die, but she wants to find the right place to do so
+ She believes it will be meaningful to die at the monolith
+ An exploration platformer in a minimally chromatic universe (echofall)
+ Travel through the world and find the monolith


Step three: Basic things are in
===============================

+ Simple level in-game format and level editor
+ Top-class tile platformer physics (wtf?)
+ Need to find a way to save the levels
+ Also prettify everything maybe?
