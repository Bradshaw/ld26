Gaeel is doing Ludum Dare #26
=============================


Walk into the club I'm like, what up I got a big cock

Theme is "minimalism"

Step one: looking for inspiration
=================================

* Listening to Burial


Step two: It's going to be a SAD game
=====================================

* Maybe listening to Burial was a bit overkill
* A girl, the last person
* She is going to die, but she wants to find the right place to do so
* She believes it will be meaningful to die at the monolith
* An exploration platformer in a minimally chromatic universe (echofall)
* Travel through the world and find the monolith


Step three: Basic things are in
===============================

* Simple level in-game format and level editor
* Top-class tile platformer physics (wtf?)
* Need to find a way to save the levels
* Also prettify everything maybe?


Step four: Of mice and men
==========================

* I need things, here is a list of things that I need:
	* ~~Loading and saving of collision map to png~~
	* Loading and saving of entity map to .lua
	* Lots of pretty pictures
	* An animated character
	* Music and sounds
	* Interactables:
		* Portals from level to level
		* Buttons and doors?
		* Other "things"
* The "Minimalism" of this game is in the use of simple sounds and graphics to induce emotion
* Feelings the player should feel:
	* Angst
	* Vulnerability
	* Sorrow
	* Pity
	* Possibly release and liberation
	* Happysad mothafocka
